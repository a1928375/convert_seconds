# convert_seconds

Write a procedure, convert_seconds, which takes as input a non-negative number of seconds and returns a string of the form '<integer> hours, <integer> minutes, <number> seconds' but where if <integer> is 1 for the number of hours or minutes,  then it should be hour/minute. Further, <number> may be an integer or decimal, and if it is 1, then it should be followed by second.
